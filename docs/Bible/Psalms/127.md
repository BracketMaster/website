### 2
> It is vain for you to rise up early,
> To sit up late,
> To eat the bread of sorrows;
> For so He gives His beloved sleep.

Simple as that.
God gives His beloved sleep.

### 3
> Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord,
> The fruit of the womb is a reward.
> Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
> So are the children of oneâ€™s youth.

Children are very cool.
