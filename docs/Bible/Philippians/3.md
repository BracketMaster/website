### 8

Having Christ is my most valuable possession.

### 12

Right now is a lot of work, but I
press on to accomplish what Christ
has called me for.

### 13
> Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; 
> but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are

 The goal is to accomplish God's destiny for your life.

### 14

> prize of the upward call of God 
> in Christ Jesus.

Is our prize in Christ fulfilling our
destiny?
