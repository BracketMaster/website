### 5
> Evil men do not understand justice,
> But those who seek the Lord understand all.

If I want to understand everything, the first
thing I must do is seek God.

### 13
> He who covers his sins will not prosper,
> But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.

Confession must be followed up with repentance.
