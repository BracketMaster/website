### 3
> Whoever loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,
> But a companion of harlots wastes his wealth.

Spending your money on prostitutes is unprofitable
and foolish.

### 7
> The righteous considers the cause of the poor,
> But the wicked does not understand such knowledge.

What is the cause of the poor?
