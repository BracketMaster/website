### 8

I must get wisdom. I must love my own soul.

### 10
> Luxury is not fitting for a fool,
> Much less for a servant to rule over princes.

What does this verse mean? In what situation would
servants rule over princes?

## 11
> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger,
> And his glory is to overlook a transgression.

There is a level of glory associated with not letting
the offense of another against you control you.

## 16
> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,
> But he who is careless of his ways will die.

There is safety in following the commandments of
the Lord.

## 23
> The fear of the Lord leads to life,
> And he who has it will abide in satisfaction;
> He will not be visited with evil.

Life can be satisfying. When you operate in the fear 
of the Lord.
