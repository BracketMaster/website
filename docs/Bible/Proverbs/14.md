### 1
> The wise woman builds her house,
> But the foolish pulls it down with her hands.

Wisdom builds up, but foolishness destroys.

### 7
> Go from the presence of a foolish man,
> When you do not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.

Hanging around a foolish man is dangerous.

### 8
> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,

The wise understand the choices they make in life.

### 18
> The simple inherit folly,
> But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

I think the simple are those don't see the 
value in assessing the meaning of their
life and their ways.

### 19
> The evil will bow before the good,
> And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

But I bet you will never find a righteous man bowing before an evil man... I think there is
a verse for this.

### 23
> In all labor there is profit,
> But idle chatter leads only to poverty.

Useless chit chat does nothing. It does not
add value to your business, in fact, its
opportunity cost is high.

### 25
> A true witness delivers souls,
> But a deceitful witness speaks lies.

We should seek out those who speak truth.

### 29
> But he who is impulsive exalts folly.

The wise wait.
