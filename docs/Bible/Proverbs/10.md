2. Being righteous is very profitable as it delivers from death.
4. Diligence is extremely valuable.
9. He who walks in integrity has nothing to worry about.
11. The words that a righteous man  says are always uplifting and life-giving.
16.  Whatever money or goods the wicked gains always go towards more 
wickedness.
17. Rejecting reproof also leads others astray.
19. There's rarely any harm in talking less.

   Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,
   but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.

23. This means that walking in the fear of the Lord is pleasure
to those who have understanding.
