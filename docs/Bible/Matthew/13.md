19. Notice how the man who received the word by the wayside
heard the word but did not have understanding. Contrast with
the guy who both heard and understood the word in verse 23.
20. I believe that the man who heard the word and received
it with joy, but had a stony heart is a man with trust issues.

Verse 22 indicates that when trouble arose, this man doesn't
endure. This suggests that the man may ask himself "can I trust
God? I've been failed before. Let me trust in myself..."

This is exactly the position of a stony heart.

44. The kingdom of God is worth everything I have and own.
