## 5
Jesus allowed Himself to be tempted by the Devil. He didn't
have to go where the Devil took Him, but he went nonetheless.

Hebrews 4:15 provides some insight into this.

> For we do not have a High Priest 
> who cannot sympathize with our 
> weaknesses, but was in all points 
> tempted as we are, yet without sin.

Jesus allowed Himself to be tempted so that he can relate
to our weaknesses.
