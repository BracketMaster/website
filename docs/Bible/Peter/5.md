Peter 1 mentions suffering a lot. 
> NKJV: 1 Pet 4:12
>
> Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christâ€™s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed
And in this verse, Peter reminds us that our brothers in the faith also suffer.
