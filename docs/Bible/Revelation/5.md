What is in the scroll? The strong angel was strong, but opening the scroll is about being worthy - not strength.
Nobody was even able to look at the scroll.

It would make sense if the elders were people - they sang - "you redeemed us"

At some point - every created thing WILL worship God. But it appears to be a priviledge to worship at the throne of God.

This idea seems consistent with other scriptures, for example, only the high priests could enter the inner temple - worship of this form was a priviledge.

Perhaps a better word is restriction. We note that the psalmist says that only the pure of heart and those with clean hands can ascend the hill of the Lord.

My conclusion is that worship is required, but proximity is a priviledge. Proximity is a component of relationship.
