### 5
> Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the 
> altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, 
> thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.

I wonder if this is related to the phrase in the Bible
"fulfillment of times"

### 7
Compare angels sounding trumpets in Revelation 8
to angels throwing vials to Earth in Revelation 15 
and 16.

These are the order of events concerning the
sounding of trumpets.

1. All trees and vegetation burned up.
2. Burning mountain destroys sea life.
3. Star falls to earth burning a third of
all waters.
4. Stars struck in what appears to be an 
accelerated death of the sun.
5. Scorpion-locust torment men.
6. Four angels kill a third of mankind.
7. Angel proclaims Christ's Lordship of the
kingdoms of the world.
