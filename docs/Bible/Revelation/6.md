### 8
> And power was given to them over a fourth of the 
> earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with 
> death, and by the beasts of the earth.

What are these beasts? They seem to be instruments
of destruction on the earth.

### 12
> I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there 
> was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as 
> sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the 
> stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its 
> late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. Then the sky 
> receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every 
> mountain and island was moved out of its place.

Black sun, red moon, dissolution of earth atmosphere,
sounds like sun death to me.
