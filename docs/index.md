# Welcome to Planet Program

I'd like to think that I'm a good programmer and an OK [mathematician](mathematics/ellipsoid_indicatrix/ellipsoid_indicatrix). 
I took advanced math classes in high school to impress some cute girl, but ended up falling in love with math instead... Go figure...

I wrote my first program when I was seven and have been programming on and off ever since. That said, software is very important to what I do, but at the end of the day, its still a tool that makes other activities I enjoy that much easier. 

Some incarnation of this website began when I was an undergrad mainly to help me keep track of projects I did in the past such as [reverse enginneering the MacSE 1987]. It still serves that function; hence its current name. But it finds other uses such as helping document interesting artifacts of programmer culture. Enjoy!

### Mathematics...

Not much new here.

I unfortunately don't have as much time as I used
to for studying emag or quantum physics. 

If you have a cool math problem you think I could 
solve, let me know!

I'm also down to work on cool small film projects!

### recent new-old tech acquisition
One of my youth pastors/mentors recently gave me his MacSE 1987!
I started writing some drivers and designing an FPGA based graphics card for the MacSE.
This is much harder than I originally thought.
